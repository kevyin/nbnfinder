# nbnfinder
Helps you look for properties on the market with NBN

## What this does
Given a domain.com.au search, it goes through all the Addresses and searches it through NBN's 
"Check your address"

Features:
    * Caches results in Python's Config format
    * Use Domain's sort by newest to get updates on your searches

## Missing features (Todo's)
* Doesn't support off the plan buildings
* Won't work if the agent didn't type in the address properly
* Unfortunately opens up Firefox/Chrome in the foreground not background (needs to be ported to ghostdriver)
* Not a website

## How to use

    
```
    # Edit cache.cfg and add the search address as a url

    [new waterloo]
    url = http://www.domain.com.au/search/buy/state/nsw/area/eastern-suburbs/region/sydney-region/suburb/mascot/victoria-park/waterloo/zetland/?bathrooms=1&to=750000&searchterm=2017%3b2020&sort=date-asc
